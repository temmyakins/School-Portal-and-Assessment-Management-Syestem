# School-Portal-and-Assessment-Management-Syestem

In this project, C# is used to develop a school portal where parents/Guardian can have access to viewing student's grades and performance in class for that semester or the school year
Most middle school and high school in west africa where I am from does not have effective school portals, even the universities as well. Only a few use their effectively, which they don't update on a regular basis.

The student web portal will contain modules such as student/parent/guardians bio-data module, admin module, account module and student billing module, academic record module, course work and complaints/response module.

Parents will be able to view their child's bio-data, test scores, exam scores, account information, bills for them, list of books for the school year through the student account. Similarly, parents will also be able to lay complaints to teachers and the school authority via the student portal
C# will be used to build this projects where the following will be used to achieve the targeted goals:
- Extracting Core Use Cases from the requirement and implenting them from Top to Bottom
-Building the models using Code-first Workflow
-Building forms with Bootstrap
-Implementing validation.
-Extending ASP.NET identity users
-Creating precise designs with CSS
